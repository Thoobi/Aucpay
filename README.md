### Revolutionizing Auction Payments with Transparency & Blockchain-Powered Trust

**Aucpay** is a decentralized payment protocol built on the [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co) blockchain, designed to simplify and secure the payment process at auction events. By leveraging smart contracts written in Clarity (Stacks’ smart contract language), Aucpay ensures that bids and payments are transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof — enhancing trust between bidders and auction organizers.

---

## 🚀 What is Aucpay?

Aucpay bridges the gap between traditional auction events and Web3 technology by introducing:

- **On-chain bidding and payment tracking**
- **Smart contract-enforced payment flows**
- **Verifiable winner selection**
- **Secure and transparent fund handling**

Whether it’s an art auction, charity event, or online collectibles sale, Aucpay ensures every payment and transaction is handled with clarity and accountability.

## 🔗 Powered by Stacks

Aucpay utilizes **Clarity**, the predictable and secure smart contract language of the **Stacks blockchain**, which settles on Bitcoin. This ensures:

- Immutable auction records
- Auditability of all bids and payments
- No hidden logic or fund mismanagement

Clarity is decidable, which means the outcome of smart contracts can be predicted without actually executing them — ensuring complete transparency for all parties involved.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Smart Contract Bidding System**: Users place bids through a Clarity-based contract, ensuring bids are recorded on-chain.
- **Auto-Winner Selection**: At auction close, the highest bidder is selected automatically based on contract logic.
- **Secure Escrow**: Funds are held securely in escrow by the smart contract until the auction ends.
- **Refund Mechanism**: Non-winning bidders are automatically refunded.
- **Organizer Payout**: Once an auction ends, the smart contract transfers funds to the auction organizer or designated wallet.

## 📜 Smart Contract Overview (Clarity)

Here are some key components of the smart contract written in Clarity:

- `start-auction`: Initializes an auction with parameters like end time and reserve price.
- `place-bid`: Accepts STX bids, ensures they are above the current highest bid, and refunds the previous bidder.
- `end-auction`: Finalizes the auction, declaring the winner and releasing funds accordingly.
- `withdraw`: Allows eligible parties to withdraw their STX after the auction ends.

Clarity’s read-only functions provide real-time insights into:

- Current highest bid
- Number of bidders
- Remaining auction time
- Winning bid and bidder address
